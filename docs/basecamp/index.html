					I want to intern at Basecamp because I want to learn at a company that gets things done with talented people.
					I feel like I am becoming stagnant in my learning. I keep hitting walls in gaining more practical experience in programming
					and making progress towards depth of knowledge not just breadth. More so, I think this internship will highlight areas in which I can
					improve and build upon my strengths. What I would really like is a concrete and focused path to push me to be better than I am now.
					This is where mentorship comes into play. I believe that it is one of the key factors that separates the average from the great.
					Another reason I want to intern this Summer at Basecamp is because it is remote friendly. I love the idea that I will be able to talk to my future
					mentor on a sunny Alaskan afternoon. Lastly, I am super EXCITED to work on real projects with real impact! These, too, can only help me become
					better. <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/what-i-did-with-my-summer-at-basecamp-9b9134fa6f3c#.nd22lwp8m">Nathan</a>,

					I am highly interested in working on programming, specifically Android and Rails. I feel most
					comfortable working in these areas and want to expand my abilities to build better applications.
					I want to see how code comes together on a global product like Basecamp and hopefully make some meaningful
					contributions. Programming has become a hobby for me. It is stimulating brain food. If I go too long without having coded something,
					I start to feel off. I also like that it is very similar to writing. It takes focused and sustained effort, 
					multiple drafts, and editing to produce desired content. Writing and programming can also be used to solve problems.
					For example, "How can programming help you think critically and become better at problem-solving". I would also enjoy
					dabbling in support too. I think hearing directly from customers would help identify critical pain points.

					My proudest moment since I learned how to program was creating and publishing my Android game, 
					<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ver2point0.colorwords&hl=en">Color Words</a>!
					It is a fast-paced color matching game with 2 play modes and 3 difficulty levels. I wanted to create a game 
					with simple game mechanics and limited beautiful visual elements so that I did not overwhelm myself. I am pleased with 
					my success. I do have experience with Ruby and Rails and really like the magic of the framework. My favorite Rails
					project is Mission Objective. Check <a href="https://mission-objective.herokuapp.com">it</a> out. I am slowly, but surely making my way into
					open source contributions. I did have my 1st public PR merged into Operation Code's code base, <a href="https://github.com/OperationCode/operationcode/issues/571">here</a>.
					I am sure you will want to see other samples of my work. Have fun on my <a href="https://github.com/ver2point0">Github</a>!

					because I am a USAF Veteran. All military members no matter their rank, service branch, and duty status are trained day one
					to be dependable. Personally, I do not make promises and plans with people if I have no intention of following through. 
					I appreciate this behavior in others. I have tenacity aka grit. Grit is a perfect trait to have especially
					while programming because that is what has seen me through bugs upon bugs in my code. I adapt quickly. Having lived
					on the West Coast, East Coast, Gulf Coast, and now Alaska, I have learned how to adapt to new surroundings, people, and different ways of doing things.
					Consequently, the constant change in the military was cake for me. By nature I am independent and self-driven. My ability to adapt quickly has only strengthened
					these traits. I go out of my way to learn concepts I find interesting and seek out answers to my curious questions.
					I have been fortunate enough to have had excellent English instructors. They emphasized how important it is to hone my speaking, reading, and writing skills and how far they can take you in life.
					The military, especially the Air Force, prides itself on excellent communication. It is made sure that all members are heard, understood, and acknowledged given that we interact with
					the public on a global scale. I regularly receive compliments. I like new ideas and am open to hearing them. My favorite ones usually come from those who have experienced 
					things I have not. On the other hand, I know that I can bring a few things to Basecamp's table that are worth consideration.
					As mentioned in "Why do you want to intern Basecamp", I am eager to learn. I am constantly learning and it is a fun experience!
