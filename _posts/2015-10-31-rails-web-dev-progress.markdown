So, I have not written a post since October 2nd. 

I know that I was writing about my progress with Udacity, however, I decided it was not necessary anymore because I had nothing to say except that I finished one lesson and was moving to the next.

I have not stopped working through the coursework, but I do not spend as much time as I used to on it each day. 

I am almost done with the Rails web dev foundation checkpoints. It is exciting to see how much I have learned and will continue to learn. 

In about 2-3 weeks, I will start working on projects. I know that they will require me to figure more things out on my own, but they will be worth it.

**Later.**
