**Continuing on from part 1 of 2**

My first adventure with Android occurred through Teamtreehouse. I knew I needed something that was structured and current with the latest Android practices. I took advantage of the free trial working through as much of the material as I could at nights before it ended. I did purchase a subscription for a few months, but couldn't put in much time with it because of work obligations. Having canceled my subscription and putting my Android learning on hold, I turned to books. 

With books, the learning process was slower and I didn't feel like I was getting any closer to learning how to develop Android applications. I intentionally stopped actively learning Android.

**Months pass.**

Towards the end of my degree, I knew that I didn't have enough practical knowledge to obtain gainful employment in my field. I wanted to remedy my situation. All the while, I read blog posts about how developers found their way into the programming world. Most were self-taught, some learned through internships, and others learned through work related training. I happened to come across the concept of coding bootcamps. I didn't know what they were, but was intrigued. I learned that they are accelerated programs to teach anyone current skills in design, web programming, mobile programming, data science, and other topics. Coding bootcamps were my remedy.

**Why Bloc?**

It me 3 to 4 months to find and choose Bloc. Bloc's mentorship sessions were a big selling point for me. It helps to have someone in your field guiding, explaining, and showing you difficult concepts. Bloc is online. It would have not been feasible for me to relocate to pursue a bootcamp style program. Bloc offers job preparation and job assistance. Part of your course curriculum involves building a portfolio to showcase what you can do and helping you to navigate how companies hire developers. At the time I found Bloc, it was one of the only bootcamps that offered **Android development** as one of its courses. I made my decision to stick with Bloc and continue my journey with Android. 

I did look at other bootcamps before I found Bloc. Most did not offer Android development as a course. None of the ones I found were available online. Very few offered 1-on-1 mentorship. Price was not a factor for me, so I did not take it into consideration. 

**Where am I now?**

I'm 2 weeks from completing the Android portion of my mobile development track (it's no longer offered if your're curious). I'm currently making a game for my capstone project. I'm looking forward to navigating the search for developer jobs and doing the second half of my track in Ruby.
