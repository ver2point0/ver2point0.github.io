   - To continue learning about making games in Android, I made this application. Replay is also composed of two screens: main and game play. This game starts out easy, but quickly becomes harder. Additionally, sound effects and animations are included to help the player learn sequences. Please, see my Github account to reference [Replay](https://github.com/ver2point0/Replay "Replay").
