<h2>The Stuff</h2>

It took me three months to get through the following courses through Codeacademy.

- Make a website
- HTML & CSS
- Ruby
- Rails
- Command line
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Make an interactive website
- AngularJS
- SQL
- PHP
- Python

I went through them in the above order to gain exposure to the different languages, skills, frameworks, and tools. I knew by the time I was finished that I would still have surface level knowledge, but be able to recognize them in the wild.

One thing that you don't do in these courses is setup the different environments yourself. I have found through personal experience that setting up your environment is a good thing to do on your own so that you can learn how it works. 

Some similarities that stick out in my mind among the languages are how they approach syntax for: looping, declaring and instantiating variables, writing functions (methods), writing classes, control flow, object-oriented programming, and arrays. These similarities made future courses easier.

<h2>The Good Stuff</h2>

By the time I got to PHP and finished Python, Codeacademy stopped being **fun**.

Why wasn't it fun?

- I didn't take breaks between each course.
- Language syntax started bleeding together (see the above bullet point).
- I felt sometimes that I was trying to write "correct" code for the editor than write code that worked.
- I like to learn things in depth not breath (surface level knowledge).
- I started losing focus (pick a language, and let it be your core).

As you read this, you're probably thinking, those reasons you mentioned for Codeacademy not being fun anymore are well within your power to fix. 

I agree.

If I were reading about another's experience, I'd want to know why it stopped being fun so I would not fall into the same pitfall.

Taking the Rails course helped me through AngularJS. I started to see the Model-View-Controller pattern in AngularJS after Rails.

I found SQL to be the most fun! That's probably because I like asking questions and to know things even if I will never apply said knowledge.

I planned on taking the Java and Git courses after Python, but I'm burned out now. We'll see if I ever get to them.
