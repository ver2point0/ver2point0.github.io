Eleven weeks ago, I started my Rails web dev foundation phase. 

Yes, I glad to be done, but I want to go back through it to really see how much I actually learned (if I have time).

I can sum up my foundation experience in three parts: learning how to program in Ruby, building a command line application, and building a web application with a test suite.

<h2>That's Ruby. Just follow her syntax.</h2>
As this title suggests, this is where I was acquainted with Ruby's magic. It's a basic introduction through the language via syntax, variables, and keywords. Along the way, I learned about reading RSpec tests. I spoke with debugging code and conditionals. I filled my fair share of arrays with numbers, strings, characters until they said, "Uncle". I helped objects send messages to each other by defining their behavior in classes. Loops tried to keep me riding his infinite roller coaster, but I prevailed using an exit plan. Hashing is a great way to store information as key/value pairs. Much like human children inherit traits and characteristics from their parents, child classes can inherit similar behavior from their parent classes. Block, you're blocking the way. Yes, you are noticed, but we need explicit information to pass to our method friends. 

<h2>Hello, Ruby? Please bring up the directory.</h2>
Guess what? All that fun stuff I mentioned in the previous section was setting me up for this section. 
Now, I can find all the droids I've been looking for...er...store their information to contact them later.
This is where I learned about how models and controllers interact in Ruby.

<h2>Yes, another web app. It's okay, Bootstrap made his presence known.</h2>
The CRUD. Enjoy the CRUD. This part is comprehensive, but where the learning accelerates, at least in my opinion. I don't want to spoil it for you. Know that you might a build something similar a popular site that rhymes with Schmeddit. If you don't know what to I'm referring, ask your friends.

Did you enjoy my section titles?
