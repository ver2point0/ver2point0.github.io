## Intro to Java programming 

Although, I do have a background in Java, I wanted to start from the beginning of the course to see what's new in Java and see how Udacity teaches it. I like that the material is presented in a video format. Visual examples are important to me and help cement concepts faster. There are forums to help you out if you get stuck. This course uses [BlueJ](http://www.bluej.org/) as its integrated development environment (IDE) because it is built for beginners with a very simple interface. If you didn't install BlueJ, Udacity has a built in IDE where you can run programs. I'd suggest getting used to using an IDE because it will make your life easier when running your own programs.

I'm using IntelliJ as my IDE of choice because it is very similar to Android Studio in terms of user interface and keyboard controls. 

I finished lesson 1. I'm moving onto lesson 2.
