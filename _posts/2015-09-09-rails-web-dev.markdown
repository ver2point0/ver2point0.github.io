<h2>Monday</h2>
My roadmap for Rails web development officially started. I did not complete any of the checkpoints because I was behind on my prework (shame on me). I quickly browsed through the roadmap to see what kind of content I would be learning and applying. 

<h2>Tuesday</h2>
I finished up the last of my prework. I had my first mentor meeting. He walked me through the roadmap which was nice. I still did not complete any of the checkpoints.

<h2>Today</h2>
I will dive into my roadmap today, and make some progress.

Stay tuned for more updates.

**Later.**
