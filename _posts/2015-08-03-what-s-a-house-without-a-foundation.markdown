title: What's a house without a foundation? part 1/2

**A house without a foundation is just house. It is a rather lame joke, but true nonetheless. A visual example might help: (house without a foundation - without a foundation = house).**

In my last blog post, I mentioned that I would expand upon it. Now, is a better time than ever to do so.

**A little background.** 

I have a B.S. in Computer Science (CS). I chose to pursue this degree because I wanted to learn how to make video games not just play them. I could have specialized by getting a degree in Game Programming (GP), however, through some research discussing the differences between CS and GP degrees, I found that CS was the better option. Almost everything I read pointed out that CS is more versatile than GP. This makes sense as I could work in any industry going the CS route as opposed to GP. 

**Why the mobile arena?**

I chose the mobile arena because I believe the barrier to entry is much lower than PC and consoles. After having taken some programming classes in different languages, and making a game, I had better insight on what it takes to build an exciting virtual experience. It is not an easy task, and can take considerable time and effort. I still was excited to craft games, but I still needed more knowledge.

**Android takes the win.**

Once I started learning Java, I found tutorials and other resources that showed me how to make games in Java. They didn't really excite me. As a I progressed with Java, I started playing more mobile games because they were required less time to play and still filled my hunger for gaming. For my Senior capstone, three of my classmates and I developed a tank game using the Slick2D and LWGJL libraries. Our game turned out pretty good and difficult, but it really wasn't going anywhere except to prove what we had learned. Choosing Android was easy an choice for me with my knowledge of Java and owning a smartphone running Android.
