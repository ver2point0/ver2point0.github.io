<h1>freeCodeCamp</h1>

Today, I officially started my freeCodeCamp journey. It's going pretty well so far. 

I'm blazing through the HTML5 section. It helps that I do have experience with HTML.

There will be periodic updates (probably every couple of weeks) about **new** things that I will learn.

That's it. :)
