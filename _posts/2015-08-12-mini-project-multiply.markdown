   - I made this application an as exercise to learn how to make games in Android. Multiply is composed of two screens: main and game play. As the player continues to answer problems correctly, the game difficulty increases and rewards appropriately. If a problem is answered incorrectly, the game and score reset. Please, see my Github account to reference [Multiply](https://github.com/ver2point0/Multiply "Multiply").
