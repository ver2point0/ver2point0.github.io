**As the title above suggests, this post is going to be a brief one about my Bloc experience so far. I'll probably do a more thorough one later.**

I finished the first half of the Android foundation in a week. I thought I could maintain that same pace for the next half, but I proved myself wrong. It took me a little over two weeks to finish the second half. Two major bugs stopped my progress. It's amazing how much user error impedes development. 

I'm starting the projects phase today. I'm sure I'll learn what truly interests me in the mobile development arena besides games.

I wonder how many projects I will complete.
