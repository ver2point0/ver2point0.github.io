<h1>Mobile to Web</h1>

Today, marks the end of my time in the Android development course. I really enjoyed the learning process, mentorship, and being able to build real applications. I'm glad that I was able to design, create, and publish an application in the play store. What an accomplishment! I will still continue my learning process with Udacity's Android Nanodegree.

Next week, I start the Rails web development course. I'm looking forward to learning how to build web applications with Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 

**Later.**
