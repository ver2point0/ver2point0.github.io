## What I'm doing.

Yes, I published my first app in the play store a few days ago. Check out my [post](http://www.dymmyd.com/2015/08/18/capstone-project-color-words.html) about it if you're curious.

I considering taking a break from coding anything at all, but thought better of it. Instead, I have scaled down how much I code everyday. What you consider intense is for you to determine.

I've decided to go through Udacity's Android [Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) curriculum to learn new things and bolster what is familiar to me. 

I'll post updates about my progress as needed.

Until then, 

**Later.**
